## Introduction

This project uses the bike sharing data set, day.csv, that’s located
*[here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset)*
and contains 17389 instances with 15 attributes. For modeling, the
response variable is the count of total rental bikes rented (*cnt*) and
12 of the 14 remaining variables will be considered for predictor
variables (*casual* and *registered* are omitted). The 12 remaining
variables include date, season, year, month, holiday, weekday, working
day, weather, temperature, feeling temperature, humidity, and wind
speed.  
Purpose of analysis:  
Methods I’ll use:

## Data

The data is read in using a relative path and saved as an object. The
data is then randomly split into a training and testing set, where 70%
of the data goes into the training set and the remaining 30% goes into
the testing set.

## Summarizations

summary statistics and plot with some general explanations

## Modeling

fit some models (two)

## Automation & Blog Post

automate so it creates report for each day of the week
